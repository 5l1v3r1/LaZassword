# LaZassword
Working Password-Grabber payload for the BashBunny, using LaZagne.
• Author: kuyaya
• Firmware support: Should work for all firmwares, but I haven't tested it yet
• Target: Windows

## Description
Payload length: ~ 30 seconds

## Configuration
You need to download the latest version of LaZagne from the [release page of LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases)
Be sure to download it in Edge (Chrome blocks the download) and temporarily disable the AV. Then make a Zip-file out of it, and place it in the /root folder of the BashBunny. Example: G:\lazagne.zip\lazagne.exe
Copy-Paste the payload into one of the switch folder. (Doesn't matter if switch1 or switch2)
Have fun!
